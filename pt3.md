# Final Project Pt. 3: Technical Notebook

## Overview

Develop the best predictive model you can for the problem you've chosen, and document your work in a technical notebook that can be shared with your peers.

## Deliverables

In the final project Git repository you created for Pt 1, create a new Jupyter notebook called `part3_scratch.ipynb`. In that notebook, iterate on the first-pass model you built in Pt. 2, using the insights you got from exploring the data at that point to guide your efforts. Systematically test different model types, hyperparameter settings, combinations of features, and feature engineering procedures. Evaluate each variation you try by measuring performance with an appropriate and consistent metric using train/test splits or cross-validation. Compare training-set performance to test-set performance to assess whether your model is underfitting or overfitting, and make it more or less complex as appropriate.

Take care to choose a regression model and metric if you are predicting a number, and a classification model and metric if you are predicting a category.

The notebook you use to develop your model will likely contain many errors and false starts. In a new notebook called `part3_clean.ipynb`, walk us through your process and findings without all of that cruft. Create well formatted sections, headers, and descriptions in markdown. Make your code as clean as you can, for instance by giving your variables descriptive names and writing functions for steps that you find yourself carrying out repeatedly. Include comments to explain why you made choices that might otherwise be puzzling.

Submit your project following the instructions in the course info document.
